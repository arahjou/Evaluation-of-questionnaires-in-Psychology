# Evaluation-of-questionnaires-in-Psychology

A fantastic with Melina Mazloum, M.sc., psychology: 
Psychologists have different tools to measure the severity of psychological disorders sand questionnaire (Such as GHQ28, PHQ9, PHQ15 etc.) is one of them. Each questionnaire consist of multiple questions, and each question has multiple answers with different scores. Participants or patients fill these forms and their mental health condition can be evaluated based on the calculated scores of these forms. In this step, psychologists depend on an evaluation sheet to put each person under a define category.

This scoring system is based on extensive psychological research, but still it was not clear to me how two persons with just one score difference can be categorized into two different groups. Therefore, I tried to test if clustering with machine learning (C.M.L.) methods can be used to categorize 60 participants in this study better than classic method.
 
To measure the rate of success for each method, two standard questionnaires were used to evaluate anxiety, depression and psychosomatic disorder. After applying the classic method and C.M.L., the number of participants which are ended up in the similar categories in both questionnaires were identified. Finally, a method which could categories participants with a higher similarity  between two  questionnaires were considered as a winner.
